# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
# CLASSES AND OBJECTS (OOPS)
# It is way of programming where we make objects which are derived from a templet (class).
# Classes - Template.
# Template is a ready made program in which we can type data and finish.
# Object is the instance of the class.
# DRY - Do not Repeat Yourself.
# To restrict the access of the functions.
# It increases the code reusability.
